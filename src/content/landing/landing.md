Welcome ðŸ‘‹ I'm a _software engineer_, product strategist, and computer science educator from Queens, New York. I build thoughtful technology that bridges design, data, and education to serve historically excluded communities. With roots as a self-taught coder and now a first-gen college graduate, Iâ€™m passionate about leveraging tech to empower others the way it empowered me.

Whether I'm leading a classroom, visualizing complex data, or defining product strategy, my focus stays the same: build for clarity, impact, and equity. I build with purposeâ€”bridging software engineering, product thinking, and data storytelling to create impactful tech solutions that uplift underserved communities. Whether Iâ€™m teaching digital equity skills, visualizing data for decision-makers, or scaling full-stack applications, I lead with curiosity, intention, and a mission to democratize access to technology.

I'm currently working with,

-   ReactJS
-   NodeJS
-   Python
-   HTML/SCSS
