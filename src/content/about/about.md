Hi, I’m George Sucuzhanay — a software engineer, product strategist, and CS educator dedicated to using technology as a force for equity. I come from Queens,New York and my journey into tech began not in a classroom, but at home — fixing routers, managing bills, and teaching myself to code with YouTube and online bootcamps. That DIY start shaped my belief that access to tech should never be a privilege. It should be a right.

Since then, I’ve built data pipelines, launched full-stack web apps, and published product briefs at places like The New York Times and Major League Baseball. I've also taught hundreds of learners — from elementary students to older adults — in both English and Spanish. I use code not just to build software, but to build understanding. My sweet spot is at the intersection of software engineering, product development, and digital education — where systems thinking meets empathy.

As a product strategist, I ask the hard questions early: Who is this for? What problem are we really solving? How do we design for scale and trust? I've led stakeholder interviews, created user stories, and translated insights into actionable roadmaps.

Education remains core to my identity. I’m planning to pursue a master’s degree in Computer Science Education, because I don’t just want to be in tech — I want to shape how it’s taught. I want to train the next generation of technologists, especially in communities like the one I grew up in. From hackathons and bootcamps to classrooms and capstone projects, my mission is to make technical skills and tech confidence accessible to all.

Whether you’re building community-based tools, creating socially impactful products, or reimagining tech education — I’m here to collaborate. Let’s build something that matters ❤️
